Their retreat the day before allowed them to gain a foothold on higher ground, and as a result, the Union line took up defensive positions in a formation that many historians have called a 'fish hook'. Major General Daniel Sickles had been assigned the task of holding the Southwestern position on the Union line, but in an effort to better utilize his artillery, he moved his 3rd Corp to an area along Emmitsburg Road known as the Peach Orchard. Unfortunately, Sickle's move creates a lengthy bulge in the Union line, and since he does not have enough soldiers to defend it, General Meade is forced to send his entire 5th Corp (along with others) to reinforce Sickles, approximately 20,000 men. Due to the geography and positioning of the two armies, this area of the battlefield will see some of the most brutal violence. A boulder-strewn hill on the south end of Houck's Ridge, known as Devil's Den by locals, was one such arena that saw significant carnage. Over the course of the day, control of Devil's Den changes hands three times before Confederate General John Bell Hood's forces secured it.

By the numbers, the Confederates outnumbered Union forces on the left flank almost two to one, and to add to the struggle, it was one of the hottest days of the summer. The natural elements and mismatch in forces proved to be an extreme challenge for Union soldiers. Confederate forces were shifting around Chamberlain's flank so much that he had to stretch his line as thin as single file. Despite heavy losses, the 20th Maine held through two subsequent charges by the 15th Alabama and other Confederate regiments for a total of ninety minutes.

Around 7:00 p.m., as dusk began to fall, and the Confederate assaults on the Union left and center were slowing, Ewell chose to begin his main infantry assault. As the Confederates attacked both the right and center, they faced tremendous difficulty from both the steep terrain and the defensive barriers the Union had assembled, and as a result, suffered high casualties.
