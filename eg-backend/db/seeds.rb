Union General John Buford's calvary men engage lead elements of Confederate General Henry Heth's division. As Buford is pushed back, Union Major General John Reyonds arrives with two brigades of the Union First Corps in an effort to slow Heth's advancing army. As fighting intesifies, Reynolds, who at the time was the highest ranking Union general on the battlefield, is killed by a bullet through the base of his skull. Following the death of Reynolds, Major General Abner Doubleday assumes command as the fighting lasts until noon. After this pause, Heth's division reengaged Union forces around 2:30PM after adding the brigades of Pettigrew and Colonel John Brockenbrough. Evenutally these combined forces prove to be too much for the First Corp, and they are driven back from the woods into the streets of Gettysburg.", date: "July 1st, 1863", union_leader: "Major General John Reynolds", confederate_leader: "Major General Henry Heth", union_army: 550, confederate_army: 800, url: "https://padresteve.files.wordpress.com/2014/05/z_maritato_ironbrigadeforward1.jpg?w=584")
